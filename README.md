Java based chat application with following features:
1. Chat using the internet
2. Chat with an AI chatbot
3. Mesh Network messaging (Via Bluetooth)
This project is build on Android studio.
The Bluetooth Chat is as of now working only upto Android 12, because higher versions require different set of permissions.
The API key is removed in the code because it gets deactivated if made public.
